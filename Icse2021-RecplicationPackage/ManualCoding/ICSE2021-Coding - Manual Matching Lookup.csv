After hanging up on a video call with my wife, we were still able to hear each other. We both could not find a way to hang up. Killing the app didn't work. I had to go to settings and force quit the Signal application."

Signal does everything Samsung did, exept for scheduling later delivery. Signal adds more privacy and ability to make free international calls and video. I would often schedule Samsung SMS messages for next morning or Monday delivery. If Signal implements Scheduled Messages, I can think of no disadvantage to using it by default."

Constant crashes clicking photos in the menu doesn't show photos instead its constantly loads or crashes. I'd be willing to pay a few dollars a year for some good work on this app. I think most people would agree. This app needs alot of work. Limited organization with only favorites working. No tags in this app. Don't expect a fun easy browsing experience here.

It then shows every photo two times, this also does not happen on the webinterface.  The ""all files"" section even managed to show a whole bunch of pics in the wrong folder (in the root folder while they should have been in a subfolder) once, prompting me to delete them. Later i noticed my desktop pc syncing those very same pictures, which this bug-ridden app had deleted from their subfolder, where they apparently had been all the time. Other sections like ""shared"" show an endless ""loading"" sometimes until i manually refresh them. Sometimes they happen to work instantly and then show ""loading"" for infinity when i refresh them. I have reinstalled the app several times. I will have to use the webinterface which works very fast and flawlessly on chrome and firefox mobile browsers."
